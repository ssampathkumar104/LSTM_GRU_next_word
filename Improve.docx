Your code and setup are mostly correct, but **the issue where the model always predicts "the"** as the next word stems from **imbalanced token frequency and possibly under-trained or overfit model behavior**. Let’s walk through the causes and **fixes**:

---

## ✅ Why Your Model Always Predicts "the":

1. **"the" is the most frequent word** in English—and probably in the Hamlet dataset.
2. **Categorical crossentropy + imbalanced labels**: The model may learn to **always predict the most frequent token** to optimize accuracy, leading to artificially high validation accuracy (\~0.7 in your case), but **poor diversity and understanding**.
3. **Poor sequence variety**: Using only line-by-line tokenization (`text.split('\n')`) instead of a continuous text window reduces language structure learning.
4. **No temperature or randomness** in prediction: Using `np.argmax()` causes the model to always pick the most probable (often boring) choice.
5. **Small dataset / shallow architecture**: You might not be training long enough or with rich enough embeddings/context.

## ✅ Fixes

Here’s how you can improve predictions:

---

### ✅ 1. **Tokenize the entire text as a sliding window, not line-by-line**

```python
# Instead of line-by-line, generate n-grams across the whole text
token_list = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences([text])[0]
input_sequences = []
for i in range(1, len(token_list)):
    n_gram_sequence = token_list[:i+1]
    input_sequences.append(n_gram_sequence)
```

✅ This preserves **language continuity** and helps LSTM learn better transitions.

---

### ✅ 2. **Use `categorical_accuracy` as a metric, not just `accuracy`**

Make sure you're tracking **how well it predicts the right word**, not just getting lucky with "the".

---

### ✅ 3. **Use sampling (temperature)** for better word prediction\*\*

Replace:

```python
predicted_word_index = np.argmax(predicted, axis=1)
```

With this **temperature sampling**:

```python
def sample_with_temperature(preds, temperature=1.0):
    preds = np.asarray(preds).astype('float64')
    preds = np.log(preds + 1e-7) / temperature
    exp_preds = np.exp(preds)
    preds = exp_preds / np.sum(exp_preds)
    probas = np.random.multinomial(1, preds, 1)
    return np.argmax(probas)
```

Update your `predict_next_word()` function:

```python
def predict_next_word(model, tokenizer, text, max_sequence_len, temperature=1.0):
    token_list = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences([text])[0]
    token_list = token_list[-(max_sequence_len-1):]
    token_list = pad_sequences([token_list], maxlen=max_sequence_len-1, padding='pre')
    predicted = model.predict(token_list, verbose=0)[0]
    predicted_index = sample_with_temperature(predicted, temperature)
    
    for word, index in tokenizer.word_index.items():
        if index == predicted_index:
            return word
    return None
```

Try with:

```python
next_word = predict_next_word(model, tokenizer, input_text, max_sequence_len, temperature=0.8)
```

---

### ✅ 4. **Try increasing embedding size and training epochs**

You’re using:

```python
Embedding(total_words, 100)
```

Try increasing to 128 or 256 and training longer **with early stopping**. Also, increase LSTM size if RAM allows.

---

### ✅ 5. **Generate longer sequences to assess quality**

Add a loop to generate full sentences, not just one word:

```python
def generate_text(seed_text, next_words, model, tokenizer, max_sequence_len, temperature=1.0):
    for _ in range(next_words):
        next_word = predict_next_word(model, tokenizer, seed_text, max_sequence_len, temperature)
        seed_text += " " + next_word
    return seed_text

print(generate_text("To be or", 10, model, tokenizer, max_sequence_len, temperature=0.8))
```

| Poor training data variety         | Use **sliding window** over full text                           |
| Overfitting or poor generalization | Add **Dropout**, tune **model size**, use **early stopping**    |
| Shallow sequences                  | Generate **longer text**, not just 1-word prediction            |
| Evaluation metric misleading       | Consider **categorical accuracy** and **validation perplexity** |
